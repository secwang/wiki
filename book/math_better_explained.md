# developing math intuition
our intuition impacts how much we enjoy a subject.  

“How do you define a circle?”  

“The most symmetric 2-d shape possible  
The shape that gets the most area for the least perimeter (the isoperimeter property)  
All points in a plane the same distance from a given point (drawn with a compass, or a pencil on a string)  
The points (x,y) in the equation x2 + y2 = r2 (analytic version of the geometric definition above)  
The points in the equation r · sin(t),r · cos(t), for all t (really analytic version)  
The shape whose tangent line is always perpendicular to the position vector (physical interpretation)”  
$$
{e}^{i\pi } 1=0
